# Exploratory Data Analysis - Supermarket Sales 
This is a practical project for data in three branches supermarket, where you can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). There are several analysis and insights findings to have a better comprehension of the sales situation in the three branches, including total sales for each, the proportion of products line sold in each branch etc. There is also a correlation determination process between target data which in this case is the total sales to other data including both numerical and categorical data. The result of the correlation is useful as known to further analysis like the predictive analysis.
## Getting Started
For the detailed code, you can access [here](https://github.com/melinahdi/EDA-Supermarket-Sales/blob/main/EDA%20-%20Supermarket%20Sales.ipynb). Feel free to suggest any advice or suggestion. I am open to collaboration and constructive feedback!
